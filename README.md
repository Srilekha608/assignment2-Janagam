###### Bali Indonesia

 Bali has been hosting travelers, tourists, **adventure seekers** and beach bums for a long time. The small island has seemingly found the perfect medium between holding strong to its local culture/customs, while catering nonchalantly to outsiders tastes. Visitors will be awestruck by the stunning landscapes, ancient temples and **traditional practices**; yet they will gladly accept the comforts of modern caf√©s, boutique shopping spots, western eateries and fun, lively bars. Bali is an excellent place to experience all the draws and **attractions of Asia**, without battling through culture shock along the way.The **adventures and stunning landscapes caught my insterest!!!**.
